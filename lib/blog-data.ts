# Entrepreneur vs. Wantrepreneur: The Truth Nobody Tells You

I've been in business for 46 years. I started my first venture at age 11—selling things door to door in my neighborhood. Since then, I've started over 100 businesses. Some succeeded wildly. Some failed spectacularly. All of them taught me something.

And here's what I've learned that most people don't want to hear: **Most people have no business being in business.**

## The Uncomfortable Truth

I'm not saying this to be cruel. I'm saying it because it might save you your life savings, your marriage, and years of stress.

When someone walks into my office or jumps on a Zoom call with me, I can usually tell within five minutes whether they're a true entrepreneur or a wantrepreneur. It's not about how smart they are or how good their idea sounds. It's something deeper.

### Signs You Might Be a Wantrepreneur

Let me be blunt with you—the way I wish someone had been blunt with me when I was younger:

1. **You're in love with the *idea* of being a business owner, not the reality of it.** You picture the freedom, the success, the respect. What you don't picture is the 80-hour weeks, the sleepless nights, the employees who don't show up, the customers who don't pay, and the constant weight of responsibility that never leaves your shoulders.

2. **You haven't done the hard math.** You have a vague sense that you'll "figure out the money part later." Let me tell you something: businesses don't fail because of bad ideas. They fail because of lack of capital. Every. Single. Time. If you can't tell me exactly how much runway you have and what your break-even point is, you're not ready.

3. **You're looking for validation, not truth.** When I tell people their idea won't work, some of them argue with me. They came to hear that they're brilliant, not to hear reality. The true entrepreneurs? They lean in. They ask why. They want to understand the holes so they can fill them.

4. **You've never failed at anything significant.** This might sound backwards, but hear me out. Failure is the best teacher in business. If you've never experienced it, you don't know how to recognize it coming. And worse, you don't know how to survive it.

## What Real Entrepreneurs Look Like

In 46 years, I've met thousands of business owners. The ones who make it share certain traits:

**They're obsessed with the problem, not the product.** They've identified something that genuinely bothers them—a gap in the market, an underserved customer, a better way of doing things. They can't NOT try to solve it.

**They understand that business is simple math with complicated emotions.** Revenue minus expenses equals profit. That's it. Everything else is just human nature getting in the way. Real entrepreneurs respect the math.

**They're comfortable being uncomfortable.** Starting a business means doing things you've never done, talking to people who intimidate you, and putting yourself out there in ways that feel exposed. If you need everything figured out before you start, you'll never start.

**They know when to quit and when to push through.** This is the hardest one. Persistence is celebrated in business culture, but sometimes the smartest thing you can do is cut your losses and move on. Knowing the difference is an art, not a science.

## The $1,000 Question

Here's why I charge $1,000 for a 30-minute consultation: because the truth is worth that much.

If I tell you that your business idea is solid and you should proceed, that $1,000 will be the best investment you ever made. You'll have confidence and a roadmap.

If I tell you that your idea has fatal flaws—and many do—that $1,000 just saved you $50,000, $100,000, maybe more. It saved you years of your life. It might have saved your marriage.

Think of it as insurance. The most expensive insurance is the kind you buy after the house burns down.

## The Choice Is Yours

I'm not here to crush dreams. I'm here to help you see clearly. Some of you reading this will realize you're wantrepreneurs—and that's okay. There's no shame in having a great job, a stable income, and a life that doesn't revolve around business ownership.

But some of you will recognize yourselves as true entrepreneurs. You've got that fire. You understand the risks and you're willing to take them anyway. You know that failure is possible, maybe even likely, and you're going to try regardless.

To you, I say: Let's talk. Because with the right guidance from someone who's actually been there, your odds of success go up dramatically.

After 100+ businesses, I've made every mistake there is. You don't have to make them all yourself.

# Why 90% of Business Advice Is Worthless (And How to Find the 10% That Matters)

Let me ask you something: Would you take swimming lessons from someone who's never been in a pool?

Of course not. That would be absurd.

So why do so many entrepreneurs take business advice from people who've never actually built a business?

## The Consulting Industrial Complex

Here's a dirty secret about the business consulting industry: most consultants have never started a business before becoming consultants.

They got an MBA. They read case studies. They learned frameworks with fancy names. Then they hung out a shingle and started telling entrepreneurs how to run companies.

I've sat in rooms with these folks. They talk about "synergies" and "value propositions" and "market positioning." They have beautiful PowerPoint decks and expensive suits.

But when I ask them a simple question—"How many businesses have you started?"—the room gets quiet.

**Theory does not pay the bills.**

## What 100+ Businesses Taught Me

I didn't learn business in a classroom. I learned it by doing.

At 11 years old, I started my first business. By 20, I'd already failed twice and succeeded once. By 30, I'd lost count of my ventures. Now, at 57, I've started over 100 businesses across dozens of industries.

Here's what that taught me that no MBA program ever could:

### 1. Every Business Fails the Same Way

Bad idea? That's actually rare. Most business ideas are decent enough.

No, businesses fail because of **cash flow**. Every single time. Either they run out of money before they become profitable, or they grow so fast they can't fund the growth, or they extend credit to the wrong customers.

The consultants will tell you about "strategic misalignment" and "market timing." I'll tell you to watch your cash like a hawk watches a mouse.

### 2. People Problems Are Really Leadership Problems

When a business owner tells me they have "employee problems," I ask one question: "What's the common denominator in all these problems?"

They look at me confused. Then it dawns on them.

The common denominator is them.

If you keep hiring "bad" employees, you're either hiring wrong or leading wrong. Usually both. The consultants will sell you personality tests and HR systems. I'll tell you to look in the mirror first.

### 3. Simple Scales, Complex Fails

The businesses of mine that succeeded? They were simple. Simple product, simple pricing, simple delivery.

The ones that failed? They were too clever. Too many product lines, too many customer segments, too much complexity.

Business professors love complexity because it's interesting to study. Actual business owners should fear it because it's expensive to maintain.

### 4. The Best Time to Quit Was Yesterday (Or Never)

Here's something they definitely don't teach in business school: sometimes the right move is to walk away.

I've closed businesses that were making money because I could see where they were headed. I've doubled down on businesses that were losing money because I could see the path to profitability.

Neither decision was "logical" by traditional metrics. Both were right.

That kind of judgment doesn't come from reading case studies. It comes from having lost money before and never wanting to feel that way again.

## How to Find Advice Worth Taking

So how do you find the 10% of business advice that actually matters? Here's my filter:

**Ask them what they've built.** Not what they've advised or consulted on. What have they actually built with their own hands and money? If the answer is "nothing," thank them for their time and find someone else.

**Ask them what they've lost.** Anyone can tell you about their wins. The real education is in the losses. If someone hasn't lost significant money in business, they haven't taken real risks, and they don't understand what it feels like when the stakes are real.

**Ask them to be specific.** General advice is useless advice. "You need to focus on your target market" is meaningless. "Your target market should be small business owners with 10-50 employees in manufacturing because here's why..." That's useful.

**Ask them to disagree with you.** Find out if they'll tell you hard truths. If they agree with everything you say, they're selling you, not helping you. I've had clients hang up on me because I told them their business was a bad idea. Some of them called back later to thank me.

## The Investment That Protects Everything Else

When you're starting a business, you're going to spend money. You'll spend it on legal, on accounting, on inventory, on marketing, on employees, on rent.

But here's what most people don't invest in: an honest assessment from someone who's been there.

That $1,000 you spend getting clarity from an experienced entrepreneur could save you $100,000 in mistakes. I'm not exaggerating. I've seen it happen dozens of times.

The business you don't start because someone showed you the fatal flaw? That's your savings account, your retirement, maybe your marriage that you just protected.

The business you do start because someone validated it and showed you the path? That's your future.

## Find Your Guide

Every successful entrepreneur I know had someone who showed them the ropes. A mentor. An advisor. Someone who had been there and could help them avoid the worst of the mistakes.

I'm not saying that has to be me. But it should be someone.

Someone who's actually built things. Someone who's failed and gotten back up. Someone who will tell you the truth even when you don't want to hear it.

Because in business, the truth is expensive to learn on your own. But it's cheap to learn from someone who's already paid the price.

# The Holy Grail of Business: How I Mastered Absentee Ownership

There's something most business books won't tell you: most business owners don't own a business. They own a job.

A job they can't call in sick to. A job they can't take vacation from. A job that demands more hours than any regular employment ever would.

I know because I've been there. Multiple times.

But I've also figured out the other way. The way where you build something that runs smoothly while you're free to do something else—start another venture, spend time with family, or just enjoy life.

I call it absentee ownership, and it's the holy grail of entrepreneurship.

## The Trap Most Owners Fall Into

Let me paint a picture. Maybe you'll recognize it.

You start a business because you're good at something. You're a great plumber, a talented designer, an incredible baker. People start paying you for your skill.

Then it grows. Now you need help. So you hire someone. But they're not as good as you, so you're constantly fixing their work.

You hire more people. Now you're managing instead of doing. But nobody makes decisions as well as you do, so you're answering questions all day.

The business gets bigger. You're not doing the craft anymore—you're putting out fires, handling complaints, negotiating with vendors, interviewing candidates, staying late to catch up on the "real work."

Congratulations. You've built a prison. And you're the only one with a key, so you can never leave.

## The Mindset Shift That Changes Everything

Here's what took me years to understand: **Your job as a business owner is to make yourself unnecessary.**

Not dispensable. Not unimportant. Unnecessary.

The business should be able to function—ideally thrive—whether you're there or not. That's the difference between owning a business and owning a job.

Most owners resist this idea. Their ego is wrapped up in being needed. "Nobody knows the business like I do." "My customers expect to see me." "My employees can't function without my input."

Maybe that's all true. But as long as it's true, you're stuck.

## The Systems That Set You Free

Over 100+ businesses, I've refined a system for building companies that run themselves. Here's the framework:

### 1. Document Everything (And I Mean Everything)

If a process exists only in your head, you don't have a business—you have a dependency.

Every single thing that happens in your business should be documented. How do you answer the phone? How do you handle a complaint? How do you order inventory? How do you close a sale?

When I build a new business now, we write the operations manual as we go. Every time we figure out how to do something, it gets documented. By the time we're up and running, there's a playbook for everything.

"But my business is too complex for that." No, it isn't. You just haven't broken it down small enough. Any task can be documented if you're willing to get specific.

### 2. Hire for Judgment, Not Just Skill

Most hiring is backwards. We look for people who can do the tasks we need done. That's table stakes.

What you really need are people who can make decisions the way you would make them—even when you're not there to ask.

That means hiring for values and judgment, not just skills. Skills can be taught. Decision-making ability is much harder to develop.

Every time an employee asks me, "What should I do about X?"—I don't just give them the answer. I explain my reasoning. Why I would make that choice. What factors I'm weighing. Over time, they learn to think like an owner. That's when you know you've got someone who can run things without you.

### 3. Build Feedback Loops

You can't be hands-off if you don't know what's happening. Absentee ownership doesn't mean ignorant ownership.

I have dashboards for every business I run. Daily numbers. Weekly trends. Monthly reviews. I can see at a glance if something is off.

But here's the key: I'm looking at outcomes, not activities. I don't care what time my employees show up as long as the work gets done and customers are happy. I don't micromanage the process; I monitor the results.

If results are good, I stay out of the way. If results slip, I dig in and figure out why. That's managing by exception, and it's the only way to scale yourself.

### 4. Accept 80% (At First)

This is the hardest one for most owners. Your people will not do things as well as you do. At least not at first.

If you demand perfection, you'll never let go. You'll always be fixing, tweaking, redoing.

Instead, accept 80%. If someone can do the job 80% as well as you can, that's good enough. Your job is to train them to get better over time, not to do it for them.

Besides, your 100% effort on one task might be worse than their 80% effort on five tasks. Your time isn't well-spent doing work others could do adequately. It's well-spent on the things only you can do.

### 5. Create Redundancy

In any of my businesses, if one person quits, the business doesn't stop. There's always someone else who knows the critical processes. There's always a backup.

This isn't about distrust. It's about resilience. People get sick. People leave. People have emergencies. A business that depends on any single person—including you—is fragile.

Build redundancy into everything. Cross-train employees. Document institutional knowledge. Have backup vendors. This isn't paranoia; it's professionalism.

## The Life on the Other Side

I want to tell you what it's like once you've built businesses this way. Because it's worth the effort.

I wake up when I want. I work on what interests me. I travel without checking my email every five minutes. I spend time with my family—real time, not distracted time.

When one of my businesses has a problem, I deal with it. But problems are the exception, not the rule. Most days, the businesses run, the revenue comes in, and I'm free to think about what's next.

This is what I mean when I say family is the key to life. I've built wealth through business. But the real wealth? It's having time. Time for the people who matter. Time for the life you actually want to live.

## The Catch

There's a catch to all of this, of course. Building businesses that run themselves requires a different skill set than just being good at your craft.

You have to learn to lead. To document. To delegate. To trust. To build systems.

These are learnable skills. I learned them the hard way—through 46 years of trial and error, through businesses that trapped me before I figured out how to escape.

You don't have to take 46 years. You can learn from someone who's already made the mistakes.

That's what I do now. I help entrepreneurs build businesses that serve their lives instead of consuming them. It's not easy work, but it's the most important work.

Because what's the point of building something if you become its prisoner?
