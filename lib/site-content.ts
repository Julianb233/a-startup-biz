  // About Tory
  about: {
    name: "Tory R. Zweigle",
    title: "Serial Entrepreneur & Business Mentor",
    tagline: "A Lifetime Devoted to Business",
    yearsExperience: "46+",
    businessesStarted: "100+",

    intro: `My name is Tory R. Zweigle, and I am a serial entrepreneur. For the last five decades, I have done nothing but eat, breathe, and sleep business. I started at age 11, beginning a lifelong journey of ideas and startups.`,

    experience: `Most people will never start a new business. And those who do usually only build one. Some will grow it into a very successful company, or expand into multiple locations. Along that path of owner–operator, you get hands-on training in people, finance, rules, regulations, legal issues, ergonomics, human nature, and hopefully some common sense.`,

    lessons: {
      title: "Lessons From a Lifetime of Business",
      content: `You learn a lot from a single business venture. If you're lucky enough to build two successful businesses, then you're on a path of hard work and intentional growth. Being self-employed means you learn every day, every month, and every year. Those lessons stay with you forever—and sometimes you even pass them along to others who cross your path in business and in life.`
    },

    perspective: {
      title: "Why Most Business Advice Fails You",
      content: `I have been helping others in business for many years. I am always asking questions, whether someone is a new entrepreneur or a seasoned owner. I am curious about every business owner's path. Rarely are two stories alike. The businesses may be similar… but the way each person gets there is completely different.

I've had so many startups that I can see what others do not. Your business is in a fishbowl to me. I can see all around it while you're inside the bowl trying to keep things going. I see the ups, the downs, the patterns, the blind spots, the opportunities, and the dangers.`
    },

    startups: {
      title: "What 100+ Startups Taught Me About True Success",
      content: `I have been in thousands of situations across the many businesses I've run. For every business I start, it's always a new journey, with new insights at new times in new places. I still learn every day. There are not many people on this planet who have started over 100 businesses. And I do not recommend it to anyone.

Even though entrepreneurship can build great wealth, it comes with a price. There are many great businesses that profit very well and give their founders a solid family life. That is the most important success of all. Family is the key to life. If you can build both—a good business and a good family life you are wealthy beyond dreams.

This is why I created a very simple and direct new venture in business consulting.`
    },

    strategy: {
      title: "Real-World Strategy, Not Textbook Theory",
      content: `I have the background and skills to give real, day-to-day advice on most startups. I don't know everything—but I do know the majority of the do's and don'ts of business. The most important part of any business is having a solid idea of what type of business you want to start. If your idea is bad from the beginning, it will likely fail early. And even a great idea can fail from lack of capital.

There are so many variables in a startup. You need every bit of experience you can get to improve your odds. I have decades of lessons—mine and thousands of others'. I have mastered the skill of listening. I dial in on the small things. Everything starts small, whether in business or in life.

I can help you avoid the biggest mistake of your life—or guide you down a proven path where the odds are on your side. When you've started as many businesses as I have, you develop the ability to "smell" what's right for today and what will matter tomorrow. You learn from the past and apply it forward.

My goal is to help people understand whether they are true entrepreneurs—or wantrepreneurs.`
    },

    warning: {
      title: "The Ultimate Goal & The Stark Warning",
      content: `I firmly believe most people do not belong in business. Some statistics show that 90% of businesses fail within the first five years. Why become a statistic when solid advice from someone seasoned like me can help you avoid the biggest potholes?

Most business consultants have never started a business before starting their consulting career. How do you give advice on something you've never done? Just like professors teaching business all over the world—they've likely never started a business. Most consultants teach theory. And theory does not pay the bills.`
    },

    absentee: `One part of business I have truly mastered is absentee ownership—the holy grail of business. It means your business runs smoothly while you are free to start another venture or simply enjoy life with family and friends.`,

I charge $1,000 for a 30-minute Zoom call. You will fill out our questionnaire beforehand so I can prepare and understand your idea, your funding, your timeline, and your plan.

During the call, I will tell you exactly what I see—good or bad. After the call, I follow up with an email explaining why your idea works or why it doesn't.

It will be the best $1,000 you ever spend for your future in business and in life.

Think of this as insurance. If you listen to the advice, you will save yourself money, stress, and possibly your life savings.

Stop throwing good money after bad.`,
